// The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is used as shorthand for an if...else statement.

// A ternary operator is written with the syntax of a question mark (?) followed by a colon (:), as demonstrated below.

// (condition) ? expression on true : expression on false

//Example

// Set age of user
let age = 20;

// Place result of ternary operation in a variable
const oldEnough = (age >= 21) ? "You may enter." : "You may not enter.";
console.log(oldEnough)
