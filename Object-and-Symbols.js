//objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. 
//An object can be created with figure brackets {â€¦} with an optional list of properties.
//example
let user = {     // an object
    name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
    age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
  };
  //The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.
