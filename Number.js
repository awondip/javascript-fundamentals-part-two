// The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

// There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.

// Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

// Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.

// We can get it as a result of division by zero:
// example
let division = (1/0)
console.log(division)
